## Other Helpful Tools

This project also relies on these tools heavily, which I'd like to recommend to you guys. (Maybe you have already used some. Technically, they are the faster and simpler versions of their ancestors)

- [**Vite**](https://vitejs.dev/): <i>Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects</i>
- [**tsup**](https://github.com/egoist/tsup): <i>The simplest and fastest way to bundle your TypeScript libraries</i>
- [**tsno**](https://github.com/egoist/tsno): <i>node with typescript support</i>
- [**pnpm**](https://pnpm.io/): <i>pnpm has built-in support for monorepositories</i>
- [**Vercel**](https://vercel.com/): <i>Vercel is the best place to deploy any frontend app</i>
- [**Bundlephobia**](https://bundlephobia.com/): <i>Find the cost of adding a npm package to your bundle</i>

## Frontend Development Resources

And here are some websites about cutting edge and trends in front-end development field you may want to see.

## Story

Years ago, when I start learning frontend development, I found a handy website called
[**TodoMVC**](https://todomvc.com/). it guide me into the wonderful JavaScript world. (And know a word called [JavaScript Fatigue](https://lucasfcosta.com/2017/07/17/The-Ultimate-Guide-to-JavaScript-Fatigue.html) later, LOL)

Time's changed, now we have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as an official package registry (which come with the [Heaviest Objects In The Universe](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/6s0wov/heaviest_objects_in_the_universe/) ;), we have [ES Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) as standard module syntax (and with still many [Common JS](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules-commonjs-modules) in the Node.js world). Now when we talk about frontend frameworks, we are basically talking about the [React](https://reactjs.org/) [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) [Angular](https://angular.io/) trinity that each one has its own huge ecosystem, or maybe newer meta-frameworks (e.g. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is built on top of React).

But that's not the end of the story, the JavaScript world kept evolving. How do we build some complicated gigantic apps and manage the code? (Have you ever seen the source of [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)? it has 3k+ TypeScript files and 80k+ lines code in
amount!)

The new era has new problems. We may use [Flux-like](https://facebook.github.io/flux/), [Observable](https://angular.io/guide/observables), [DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design), [FRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming), or other fancy patterns to organize UI states, but it seems there is still no one silver bullet that fits all. What about CSS? Do you use some [CSS preprocessors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS_preprocessor), or ever think about [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and [CSS-in-JS](https://css-tricks.com/a-thorough-analysis-of-css-in-js/) in your projects? (I personally prefer [Atomic CSS](https://antfu.me/posts/reimagine-atomic-css))

After all these mess, I decided to play around and try different stuff, sense these concepts and principles under the hood by building a simple Todo App **one more time**.
